# 🌀 AirBearing.AI

**AI-powered engineering tool for hybrid gas-lubricated bearings**

AURA RotorCalc is a precision SaaS utility for advanced engineers.  
It enables rapid, physics-based modeling of gas-static systems with:

- ✅ Axial & radial load capacity calculation
- ✅ Stiffness and damping evaluation
- ✅ Air consumption estimation
- ✅ Pressure-based integrals
- ✅ Fully configurable geometry & nozzle patterns

## 🧠 Why This Matters

Non-contact gas-lubricated bearings are the future of high-precision, wear-free mechanics — powering:

- Aerospace turbines and cryogenic systems  
- Semiconductor and nanotech actuators  
- Rotor dynamics and magnetic levitation R&D  

Yet **no modern tools exist** that allow engineers to model real bearing geometries with gas film dynamics.  
**AirBearing.AI** is the first to bridge this gap with Python + AI-powered insights.

> We believe this is a $1M+ deeptech niche waiting to be unlocked.
