**AI-powered calculator for gas-lubricated bearing systems.**

AURA RotorCalc is a precision tool that calculates:
- Radial / Axial load capacity 
- stiffness
- Air consumption 
- Pressure-based integrals for hybrid gas bearings
- Configurable nozzle and geometry parameters

## рџ§  Why This Matters

Non-contact gas-lubricated bearings are a future-proof, wear-free solution for:
- Aerospace and cryogenics
- Rotor dynamics
- Precision machinery

There are **no modern tools** available to model arbitrary configurations with dynamic gas pressure and real geometry.

> We believe this is a $1M+ niche waiting to be unlocked.
